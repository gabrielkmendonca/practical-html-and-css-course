    <main>
        <div  class="bg1">
            <p>I'm getting tired of this show <br>
                Technology everywhere I go <br>
                People don't talk face to face <br>
                They text in a digital space. <br>
                Twitter, TikTok, Instagram fame <br>
                Always running the same game <br>
                Hearts and likes replace a smile.</p>
        </div>
        <div  class="bg2">
            <p>Emails colder than the night <br>
                Chats that vanish out of sight <br>
                Conversations short and fast <br>
                Moments too quick to ever last <br>
                Selfies posted every day <br>
                Real life slipping far away <br>
                Silence louder than before.</p>
        </div>
        <div  class="bg1">
            <p>Children don't run in the street <br>
                No ball to kick, no friends to meet <br>
                They'd rather stay behind the screen <br>
                Living in a glowing machine <br>
                Old guitar collects the dust <br>
                Stories fading into rust <br>
                Tradition drowned in neon light.</p>
        </div>
        <div  class="bg2">
            <p>But deep inside the soul remains <br>
                Old roots stronger than the chains <br>
                Voices rise with simple song <br>
                To remind where we belong <br>
                Though the world may digitize <br>
                Culture never truly dies <br>
                It survives in heart and verse.</p>

            <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>
            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used mobile devices worldwide. But perhaps you didn't know that this friendly mascot has a name and a very interesting story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
            <h2>The First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured, and the task was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more appealing way.</p>

            </picture>
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with fewer lines and in a flatter way. The drawing should also be easily identifiable to anyone looking at it. Thus, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot, was born.</p>
            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid" style="max-width: 300px;">
            <p>The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> design came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the bathroom side, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, to the point.</p>

                <p>Another interesting fact about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet treat, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never happened, as Google decided to end this fun practice and began using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>

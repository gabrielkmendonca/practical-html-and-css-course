            I'm growing tired of this age
            Of all this technology
            We only speak through emails
            So brief, so cold, no energy
            Twitter and Facebook reign
            Before I go insane
            I'll tell it all poetically

            It isn't like the days before
            Now everything is short and fast
            “You” is just two letters now
            The rest was scrapped and didn't last
            To show someone you care
            A flower's enough to share
            A heart emoji's cast

            The “at sign” has no weight at all
            It's just part of an address
            A dot no longer ends the line
            It starts a site, no less
            Now it's always “dot com”
            If the website is strong
            Its price will soon impress

            And worse, this new language play
            With symbols made to replace
            A semicolon, a little star
            A scribble takes its place
            One mark means “kiss to you”
            Another—guess its clue
            Decipher this coded face

            I miss the letters written slow
            By hand, with heart and care
            You'd send them in the summertime
            Arriving late, but rare
            They carried real emotion
            Across the miles, devotion
            A soul revealed right there
        </section>
        <section>
            But now I write and hit “send”
            It reaches in a blink of time
            Yet when I try to talk again
            The other's left online
            They've switched to another app
            The world is caught in trap
            Of screens that steal our mind
        </section>
        <section>
            But thankfully, for prayer
            No internet is required
            God listens to each voice
            No password's ever wired
            Two knees become your colon
            Your lips the true console
            And He reads what's inspired

                I'm growing tired of this age <br>
                Of all this technology <br>
                We only speak through emails <br>
                So brief, so cold, no energy <br>
                Twitter and Facebook reign <br>
                Before I go insane <br>
                I'll tell it all poetically
            </p>

                It isn't like the days before <br>
                Now everything is short and fast <br>
                “You” is just two letters now <br>
                The rest was scrapped and didn't last <br>
                To show someone you care <br>
                A flower's enough to share <br>
                A heart emoji's cast
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                The “at sign” has no weight at all <br>
                It's just part of an address <br>
                A dot no longer ends the line <br>
                It starts a site, no less <br>
                Now it's always “dot com” <br>
                If the website is strong <br>
                Its price will soon impress <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And worse, this new language play <br>
                With symbols made to replace <br>
                A semicolon, a little star <br>
                A scribble takes its place <br>
                One mark means “kiss to you” <br>
                Another—guess its clue <br>
                Decipher this coded face
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                I miss the letters written slow <br>
                By hand, with heart and care <br>
                You'd send them in the summertime <br>
                Arriving late, but rare <br>
                They carried real emotion <br>
                Across the miles, devotion <br>
                A soul revealed right there
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                But now I write and hit “send” <br>
                It reaches in a blink of time <br>
                Yet when I try to talk again <br>
                The other's left online <br>
                They've switched to another app <br>
                The world is caught in trap <br>
                Of screens that steal our mind <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But thankfully, for prayer <br>
                No internet is required <br>
                God listens to each voice <br>
                No password's ever wired <br>
                Two knees become your colon <br>
                Your lips the true console <br>
                And He reads what's inspired
            </p>
